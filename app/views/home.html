      <p class="text-justify">I have studied and developed many skills around product development and engineering.
      I possess a tremendous affinity for building and improving things - always seeing technology as a stepping stone to a quality of life for humanity.
      I went through various areas of knowledge and programming, through front-end and later back-end, turning my generalized knowledge into a full-stak development.
      For me, knowledge is a greater tool, and also a weapon, to change the lives of each one of the people of our world.

      <p class="text-justify">I had an unique trajectory in my academic life and I went through several areas such as Physics, Social Sciences and Literature.
        I venture into the world of writing in my free time and it helps me a lot in my creative development. Science fiction and fantasy appeal to me for so many reasons.
        The main one, I think, has to do with an incessant need for discovery. This also answers another question about my relentless desire to travel and meet different people and places.
        If you understand mbti you know that I am ENTP, then a native builder.
